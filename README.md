# Gist

This is a fast and straightforward project where I set up a Rails app to be a data-producing APIâ€¦ which is just a fancy way of saying that all your controller methods will render data instead of HTML. Consider this a drill in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. This app is a part of the Odin Project's course (source: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api).
